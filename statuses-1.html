	<h2>Running in San Francisco</h2>
	<br>
	<p>
	I've been running seriously for 4 years now. As I was living in The Netherlands before coming to SF, I was used to running on flat routes and didn't get to run uphill much (except for that one sad lonely hill in the park next to my home).

	Having been living in SF for about 2 weeks, I immediately felt the difference when going for a jog in my neighborhood. There are steep (I'm guessing 45&#176; incline, if not more!) hills everywhere I go. Most of the time I'm out of breath when I reach the top (that is, the top of the block, not the actual hill). I'm really looking forward to reaping the benefits of these hill repeats.
