				<h2>Running in San Francisco</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					I've been running seriously for 4 years now. As I was living in The Netherlands before coming to SF, I was used to running on flat routes and didn't get to run uphill much (except for that one sad lonely hill in the park next to my home). 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Having been living in SF for about 2 weeks, I immediately felt the difference when going for a jog in my neighborhood. There are steep (I'm guessing 45&#176; incline, if not more!) hills everywhere I go. Most of the time I'm out of breath when I reach the top (that is, the top of the block, not the actual hill). I'm really looking forward to reaping the benefits of these hill repeats.

				<h2>Running on treadmills</h2>
				<br>	
				<p>
					Since I am a night owl, I prefer to run in the evening so running on a treadmill is more convenient for me as it's safer.

				<h2>Training for San Francisco half marathon</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					It all started again in 2008 when I wanted to go back to sports but didn’t want to spend too much money in fitness club. Thereby I decided to challenge myself and ask a friend to train with me at running: only running shoes and fresh air – that was a good goal. So I started and as I used to do competition, I decided to train for a half marathon. I ran 2 of them and had to stop for my little one. Today is a new part of challenge and hopefully I will go back to running again for the SF half marathon.

				<h2>Secretly running at night</h2>
				<br>
>>>>>>> master
				<p>
					Running was the type of activity I abhorred in high school. Though I admired the discipline and endurance of those who ran, I myself had no will to stomach the side stitches, aching lungs and mild nausea from prolonged running.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
					This changed when I met Siphan and learned about her experience running marathons from her personal website, amsterunner.com. I felt we were similar in spirit, and yet she had managed so much personal growth by pushing herself. After being inspired by her, I secretly started running at night so I limit my embarrassment as a beginner. My night runs were chilly and lonesome, but worth it. NO PAIN, NO GAIN.

					<h2>Staying fit while preventing injuries</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					I used to run cross-country races with distances up to 10 miles. Unfortunately, I suffered a knee injury and I've been really careful about my training ever since. I recently picked up running again but have to build up slowly so as to ease the impact on my knees.

					<h2>I want to be buff</h2>

				<p>
					I actually don't like running, but my sister has been sneaking out to run at night and as I'm a competitive person this has given me the courage to pick up running too. I just want to be buff.
